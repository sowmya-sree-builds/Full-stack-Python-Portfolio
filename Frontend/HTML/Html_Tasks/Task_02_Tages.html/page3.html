    <h2>I Travelled across various places like:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tirumala - Tirupati</li>
        <li>Arunachalam</li>
        <li>Golden Temple</li>
        <li>Kanchipuram Kamakshi Temple</li>
        <li>Tiruthani</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These devotional places taught me a lot about 
       <strong>Sanatana Dharma</strong>, 
       <b>Hindu religion</b>, and 
       <b>spirituality</b>.
