    <title>Hey Viewer, Now Listen to My Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>I am a curious person who thrives on seeking knowledge at any opportunity I get.</p>

    <p>I am <strong>Sowmya Sree Alla</strong>,
         a recent B.Tech graduate in Electronics and Communication 
         Engineering.</p>

    <h3>You must be probably wondering why I'm trying to get into software.
         Huh! Must be like everyone else?</h3>

    <h1>Nope. Simple — I am curious.</h1>

    <p>I like to see how just a few simple lines of code can turn into.
         something that makes our lives much simpler and easier.</p>

    <p>How everyone gets things done that usually take hours, days, months,
         or even years — in just minutes.</p>

    <p>Whether it's animation, transportation, or detecting cancer cells
         beforehand...</p>

    <h3>Everything is happening because someone, somehow, built these 
        systems.  
    And yeah — now I am trying to learn how this technology works,  
    dive into this ocean of knowledge, and build something useful for
     everyone.</h3>
